# Graphs

Discrete Math labs.

### Short description

This program implements all tasks of all 6 labs from graphs visualization to
Dijkstra's algorithm. All logic of graphs and their communication was written
by myself while visualization is made using built-in Java UI framework **Swing**.

### Architecture

Code is divided into few packages. There are short description for every of them,
and you can find more detailed information inside this modules folders.

* [main](https://github.com/ALEGATOR1209/Graphs/tree/master/src/main) - main (hah, unexpected, yeah) package of all project. It contains UI elements and some
algorithms.
* [graphs](https://github.com/ALEGATOR1209/Graphs/tree/master/src/graphs) - graph logick package. It contains classes that represents graphs, vertexes, edges, etc. 
* [graphics](https://github.com/ALEGATOR1209/Graphs/tree/master/src/graphics) - contains different elements that are responsible for drawing and visualization.
* [templates](https://github.com/ALEGATOR1209/Graphs/tree/master/src/templates) - different templates that I are too often used to be reimplemented everytime.
