# Main package

This package contains different classes that is responsible for UI and main algorithms
like Kruskal, Prim or Dijkstra's algoritms.

Short description of every class:

* Main - launches program;
* Window - main window witch depicts Graphs, allows to change graph settings and
show things like condensation, matrixes, etc.
* WaysWindow - window that represents ways manager. There you can find all ways of length 2 or 3.
* SearchWindow - window that represents mechanism of deep or weight search and matrix of search tree.
* SpanningWindow - implements Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.
* DijkstraWindow - implements Dijkstra's algorithm for minimal way and broken version for maximal way.
